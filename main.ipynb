    "## Title: Graph Analysis for Maximum Chromatic Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I have been exploring graph coloring and the chromatic polynomial as part of my undergraduate mathematics research. I analyzed a given dataset of chromatic polynomial of all connected graphs up to order 9, provided by my research advisor, and studied their respective chromatic vectors. I also investigated various graph properties to gain insights into the characteristics of graphs that yield the largest chromatic vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Packages and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "For this research project, I used the following Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- NetworkX: for graph theory and graph operations.\n",
    "- NumPy: for data manipulation and matrix operations.\n",
    "- SciPy: for statistical computations.\n",
    "- Matplotlib: for graph visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my research project will accomplish the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load and preprocess the dataset of connected graphs up to order 9 using Pandas.\n",
    "2. Sort the dataset by the chromatic vector and group it by vertices and edges using Pandas.\n",
    "3. Utilize NetworkX in conjunction with Pandas to calculate and add the following graph properties to the dataset:\n",
    "   - Number of spanning tree\n",
    "   - Number of biconnected components\n",
    "   - Number of 3-cycles\n",
    "   - Number of 4-cycles\n",
    "   - Number of 5-cycles\n",
    "   - Number of 6-cycles\n",
    "   - Number of spanning trees\n",
    "   - Degree sequence\n",
    "   - Degree variance\n",
    "   - Degree deviation\n",
    "4. Utilize Pandas to analyze the dataset and identify the graphs that yield the largest chromatic vectors in their respective groups.\n",
    "5. Statistical analysis using Pandas and SciPy to calculate the percentile rank of maximum chromatic vector graph properties versus other non-max graphs within their group.\n",
    "6. Visualize graphs and results using NetworkX in conjunction with Matplotlib for data visualization."
